<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>A little about me, I'm 22 years old and was born and raised in Seattle. I graduated high school in 2018 and have been working ever since. When I'm not working I really like to watch sports,
my favorite sports to watch would have to be Hockey and baseball. I also like to play video games and get out into the mountains sometimes.
